# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**If you believe you have discovered a security issue within a Qitar product or service, please reach out to us
directly over email: [security@bullabs.dev](mailto:security@bullabs.dev).** We will then open a
[GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/bullabs/qitar/security/advisories) for tracking the fix.

Bullabs values the members of the independent security research community who find security vulnerabilities and work
with our team so that proper fixes can be issued to users. Our policy is to credit all researchers in the fix's release
notes. In order to receive credit, security researchers must follow responsible disclosure practices, including:

- They do not publish the vulnerability prior to the Bullabs team releasing a fix for it
- They do not divulge exact details of the issue, for example, through exploits or proof-of-concepts
